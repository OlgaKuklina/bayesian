=====

**Bayes** is a small Python class to reason about probabilities.
It uses a Bayesian system to crunch belief updates and spew likelihoods.

`b = Bayes([.5, .5])`: creates a new scenario with two equally likely classes

`b.update([.9, .1])`: updates the scenario with an event that is 9 times more
likely to have happened in the first class

`print(b.most_likely())`: prints which of the two classes is now more likely
  

Example Usage
-------------

    print ' -- Spam Filter --'
    # Database with number of sightings of each words in (genuine, spam)
    # emails.
    words_odds = {'buy': (5, 100), 'viagra': (1, 1000), 'meeting': (15, 2)}
    # Emails to be analyzed.
    emails = [
              "let's schedule a meeting for tomorrow", # 100% genuine (meeting)
              "buy some viagra", # 100% spam (buy, viagra)
              "buy coffee for the meeting", # buy x meeting, should be genuine
             ]

    for email in emails:
        # Start with priors of 90% chance being genuine, 10% spam.
        # Probabilities are normalized automatically.
        b = Bayes([('genuine', 90), ('spam', 10)])
        # Update probabilities, using the words in the emails as events and the
        # database of chances to figure out the change.
        b.update_from_events(email.split(), words_odds)
        # Print the email and if it's likely spam o rnot.
        print email[:15] + '...', b.most_likely()

    print ' -- Classic Cancer Test Problem --'
    # 1% chance of having cancer.
    b = Bayes([('not cancer', 0.99), ('cancer', 0.01)])
    # Test positive, 9.6% false positives and 80% true positives
    b.update((9.6, 80))
    print b
    print 'Most likely:', b.most_likely()


    def b():
        return Bayes((0.99, 0.01), labels=['not cancer', 'cancer'])

    # Random equivalent examples, all achieve the same result.
    b() * (9.6, 80)
    (b() * (9.6, 80)).opposite().opposite()
    b().update({'not cancer': 9.6, 'cancer': 80})
    b().update((9.6, 80))
    b().update_from_events(['pos'], {'pos': (9.6, 80)})
    b().update_from_tests([True], [(9.6, 80)])
    Bayes([('not cancer', 0.99), ('cancer', 0.01)]) * (9.6, 80)
    Bayes({'not cancer': 0.99, 'cancer': 0.01}) * {'not cancer': 9.6,
                                                   '
